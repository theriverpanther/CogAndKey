# Cog & Key - Deadbolt

## About
Cog and Key is a 2D action platformer developed by the team DeadBolt for the RIT Game Design and Development Masters Capstone in 2023 - 2024. The game is inspired by the Studio Ghibli art style and Steampunk aesthetics; The story is set in a dystopian steampunk world where industrialization has taken over. Humanity created clockwork automatons to take care of menial tasks, but their AI evolved into a hive mind that sees humans as disposable. As such, humanity has been pushed into the wilderness. The protagonist aims to eliminate the source of the hive mind and deactivate the automatons. They possess a key that can interact with the automatons and parts of the environment to wind them forward, lock them in place, or wind them in reverse.

You are the Key.
